It is heavily based upon the book ""The Things They Carried"" by Tim O'Brien. The majority of these objects were sourced from members of the community in St. Joseph County, Indiana.</p>",True,1,2017-10-16T20:24:30+00:00,46022,users,http://bigreadstjoe.omeka.net/api/users/46022,3,exhibit_pages,http://bigreadstjoe.omeka.net/api/exhibit_pages?exhibit=1,True,big-read-st-joe,Big Read St. Joe,http://bigreadstjoe.omeka.net/api/exhibits/1
